The systems was developed to solve the timetabling problem being faced by school of science and technology, Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, Abeokata, Nigeria.

The system has capabilities for input of the various courses, halls, departments, invigilators, time slot, lecturers and the specification of a few constraints from which the timetable is constructed. The timetabling system for this project seeks to generate optimal timetables using the principles of genetic algorithm (selection and crossover).
